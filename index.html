    <h1>CHAPTER 06 TO 09</h1>

    <h3>
      1.  Program to perform arithmetic operations and display the result:
      <br><p>In this program, we start with the initial value of a as 10. <h3></h3>

        ++a increments the value of a by 1 before evaluating the expression, so the value of ++a becomes 11. <br>
        a++ increments the value of a by 1 after evaluating the expression, so the value of a++ is still 11, but then the value of a becomes 12. <br>
        --a decrements the value of a by 1 before evaluating the expression, so the value of --a becomes 11. <br>
        a-- decrements the value of a by 1 after evaluating the expression, so the value of a-- is still 11, but then the value of a becomes 10 again. <br>
        The program displays the results at each stage to show the changes in the value of a.
        
        
        
        
       
    </p><h3>
     2. Explanation of the script: </h3>
    
    <!-- <p>Stage 1: --a; <br>
        The value of 'a' is decremented by 1 (a becomes 1).
        <br>
        Stage 2: --a - --b; <br>
        The value of 'a' is decremented by 1 again (a becomes 0), and 'b' is decremented by 1 (b becomes 0). The expression becomes 0 - 0.
        
        Stage 3: --a - --b + ++b; <br>
        The value of 'a' is decremented by 1 once more (a becomes -1). The value of 'b' is then incremented by 1 (b becomes 1). The expression becomes -1 - 0 + 1.
        
        Stage 4: --a - --b + ++b + b--;<br>
        The value of 'b' is used in the expression (b is 1) and then decremented by 1 (b becomes 0). The final expression becomes -1 - 0 + 1 + 1.
        
        So, the value of 'result' is 1.</p> -->
